# Handwritten Character Recognition
Handwritten Character Recognition is used to recognize handwritten English alphabets A-Z. There are two types of Handwritten Character Recognition. One is offline character recognition and another is online character recognition. In offline character recognition, the letter is captured optically by a scanner and the writing is available as an image. In online character recognition, data is dynamic. It is also known as pen based trajectory. In this project, I have implemented offline character recognition. 

I have used Kaggle dataset A-Z handwritten alphabets by Sachin Patel which consists of 372450 images of alphabets of size 28*2. It is present in the form of CSV file.
